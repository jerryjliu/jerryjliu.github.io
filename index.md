ML Eng Manager at Robust Intelligence, leading our efforts around model monitoring and AI Firewall. Author of [GPT Index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index). 

I'm broadly interested in generative models (including LLM's), AI for systems, systems for AI. I also follow the startup community and am interested in understanding AI products and emerging growth opportunities: MLOps, vertical LLM's, horizontal platforms (Databricks, Scale AI, etc.), and more.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Uber ATG, working on advancing state-of-the-art for learning-based compression as well as joint prediction/planning.  Before that I was a machine learning engineer at Quora, where I worked on the feed ranking system. I graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton in '17 with a B.S.E in CS and certificate in finance. 

I enjoy reading ML papers, reading non-ML books, eating spicy food, playing tennis, and playing games.

### Project Samples
* [GPT Index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index). Data structures that are created by / used by GPT-3 in order to traverse external data.
* [Star Wars Boids](https://jerryjliu.github.io/star_wars_boids/). Class project with [Kevin Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suyang-kevin-wang-62459990/), extend Boid behavior to an adversarial setting and made everything Star Wars. 
* [Force Split PR on Microsoft LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/pull/1310). Added ability to force decision tree splits.
* A bunch of hackathon projects back in the day.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
