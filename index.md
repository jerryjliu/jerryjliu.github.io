I recently joined Robust Intelligence as an ML Eng Manager! Working with brilliant researchers/engineers to help secure AI as its usage explodes around the world. Shoot me an email if you're interseted! 

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Uber ATG, working on advancing state-of-the-art for learning-based compression as well as joint prediction/planning. I'm broadly interested in generative models, IL/RL, as well as practical applications derived from the latest research. Before that I was a machine learning engineer at Quora, where I worked on the feed ranking system. I graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton in '17 with a B.S.E in CS and certificate in finance. 

I also follow the startup community and am interested in understanding products and emerging growth opportunities in b2b, MLOps, and hard-tech robotics. I enjoy reading ML papers, reading non-ML books, eating spicy food, and playing a variety of social games.

### Project Samples
* [Star Wars Boids](https://jerryjliu.github.io/star_wars_boids/). Class project with [Kevin Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suyang-kevin-wang-62459990/), extend Boid behavior to an adversarial setting and made everything Star Wars. 
* [Force Split PR on Microsoft LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/pull/1310). Added ability to force decision tree splits.
* A bunch of hackathon projects back in the day.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
